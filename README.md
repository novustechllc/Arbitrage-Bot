## What is Arbitrage?

Arbitrage is a sophisticated trading strategy that capitalizes on price discrepancies of identical assets across different markets. By simultaneously purchasing at lower prices and selling at higher prices, traders can secure risk-free profits while promoting market efficiency.

## Why Blockchain Arbitrage?

Blockchain arbitrage offers multiple advantages for developers:

- **Financial Opportunity**: Leverage price inefficiencies across decentralized exchanges
- **Skill Enhancement**: Develop advanced blockchain development expertise
- **Market Efficiency**: Contribute to price equilibrium across trading platforms
- **Strategy Integration**: Incorporate into broader algorithmic trading systems
- **Liquidity Enhancement**: Occasional improvement of market liquidity in emerging tokens

## Verification and Security

Every code modification undergoes rigorous verification and digital signing. This ensures the absolute integrity and authenticity of our codebase. We strongly advise against using any unverified modifications, as they may contain malicious elements.

## Project Documentation

Our codebase features extensive documentation with comprehensive inline comments, providing clear explanations of functionality throughout all components.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/novustechllc/Arbitrage-Bot.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Ensure you have `node.js` and `npm` installed before running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following parameters:

```env
ARB_FOR=""             # Token0 address
ARB_AGAINST=""         # Token1 address
PRICE_DIFFERENCE=""    # Target price difference between DEXs
UNITS=""               # Price reporting units
GAS_LIMIT=""           # Maximum gas limit
GAS_PRICE=""           # Gwei price
```

For configuration examples, refer to our [documentation](./Arbitrage-Bot-Project-Documentations/.env.example).

**IMPORTANT**: Maintain strict privacy of your `.env` file and never share its contents.

## Development Environment

1. Configure your deployment environment by forking your target network for the Hardhat node. We recommend using a personal RPC URL for optimal reliability. Create Web3 API keys at [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).

2. Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
API_KEY=""        # Your Web3 API key
PRIVATE_KEY=""    # Hardhat wallet private key
```

## Deployment Process

### Launch Hardhat Node

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

### Deploy Trading Contract

```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/1_deploy.js
```

Copy the deployed contract address and update the `ARBITRAGE_ADDRESS` field in [config.json](./config.json).

### Start the Trading Bot

```bash
node bot.js
```

For detailed explanations of the trading bot functions, consult our [documentation](./Arbitrage-Bot-Project-Documentations/Trading-Bot-Functions-Explanation.md).

### Trigger Arbitrage Simulation

Since the forked blockchain state remains static, we must simulate price movement to trigger arbitrage:

```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/2_manipulate.js
```

**Note**: After running this script, you may need to restart your Hardhat node and redeploy contracts for subsequent tests.

This simulation only affects your local blockchain, not the actual network. For tokens other than the provided example (LINK/WETH), you'll need to:
- Identify and use a relevant whale address from block explorers
- Adjust token manipulation amounts
- Modify profitability parameters in the `executeTrade` function

## Technical Details

The [Server](./helpers/server.js) script establishes and maintains a local server instance for the application.

### Strategy Implementation

The current implementation demonstrates a basic strategy using the **manipulate.js** script to alter Uniswap prices. After price manipulation, the system:
1. Fetches reserves from Uniswap and Sushiswap
2. Determines the lower LINK amount
3. Divides this amount by half for trade execution

This division approach is provided as an example and may not be optimal for all strategies.

### Mainnet Deployment

For production deployment instructions, refer to our [mainnet documentation](./Arbitrage-Bot-Project-Documentations/Mainnet.md).
